# Workd — Implementation Decisions

Decisions made while implementing [`design.md`](design.md), including where the
implementation deliberately deviates from it. Newest last. Each entry says what
was decided, why, and what would make us revisit it.

---

## D-001 — Rust, one Cargo workspace (2026-10-07)

**Decision.** `workd` (daemon) and `workctl` (CLI) are Rust, in one Cargo
workspace: `crates/{core,protocol,client,daemon,cli}`, with the Tauri desktop
app to come in `apps/desktop`.

**Why.** The daemon sits on the OS boundary (PTYs, signals, Unix sockets,
process lifecycle) and is expected to grow downward toward systems code. The
Tauri app's core is Rust too, so domain and protocol types are shared verbatim.
Single static-ish binaries keep `scp workd host:~/.local/bin/` as the install
story. (User decision; see design §32.)

## D-002 — CLI-first dogfooding before any GUI (2026-10-07)

**Decision.** Every phase lands in `workctl` first; the desktop UI is the last
phase and is gated on the CLI feeling excellent. (User decision; design §33.)

## D-003 — Daemon listens on a Unix socket, reached via `ssh host workd dial` (2026-10-07)

**Deviation from design §6**, which proposed `localhost:<port>` plus an SSH
port-forward.

**Decision.** `workd` listens on `~/.workd/run/workd.sock` (mode `0600`, in a
`0700` directory) and never on TCP. Clients run `ssh <host> ~/.local/bin/workd
dial`; `dial` bridges the SSH channel's stdin/stdout to the socket and starts
the daemon first if it isn't running. `workctl` passes
`-o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600` (sockets in
`~/.config/workd/cm/`) so repeated connections reuse one SSH connection.

**Why.**
- A TCP port on `localhost` is reachable by *every* local user on the host;
  anyone connecting could create sessions, i.e. run commands as you. A Unix
  socket is protected by file permissions.
- No port allocation or tunnel lifecycle to manage, no stale forwards, and it
  works with sshd configs that disable TCP forwarding.
- Auto-start in `dial` means "if `ssh host` works, workd works" — no service
  manager setup needed.

**Still true:** SSH is the only transport (rule 4); the daemon has no network
exposure.

**Revisit if** a client needs many concurrent streams over one channel (then:
multiplex streams inside one connection rather than one SSH channel each).

## D-004 — Protocol v1: JSON lines + binary attach frames (2026-10-07)

*Open decision in design §35; current choice.*

- Newline-delimited JSON. Server sends `hello {protocol, version}` first; client
  sends `{id, method, params}`; server replies `{type: "response", id, result |
  error}`. Methods are namespaced (`workspace.create`, `session.attach`, …).
- `session.attach` upgrades the connection to binary frames
  (`[kind u8][len u32 BE][payload]`: data, resize, detach, exit). One attach per
  connection.
- `events.subscribe` turns the connection into a stream of `event` messages.
- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is checked by the client; bump on incompatible change.

Types live in `crates/protocol` and are shared by every client.

## D-005 — Persistence: `state.json` + `events.jsonl` (2026-10-07)

*Open decision in design §35; current choice.*

All durable daemon state is one JSON document, `~/.workd/state/state.json`,
rewritten atomically (temp file + fsync + rename) on every change. Events are
appended to `~/.workd/state/events.jsonl`. Small, transparent, trivially
inspectable; fine for tens of workspaces.

Events carry ids, names, kinds and exit codes only — never commands or
environment values (design §19). Enforced by a test.

**Revisit if** state grows large or needs concurrent writers (→ SQLite), or the
event log needs rotation.

## D-006 — Launch environment: captured login env, delivered via private file (2026-10-07)

Design §17 says not to rely on interactive shell hooks and §19 says "if it works
after `ssh host`, it should work in Workd".

**Decision.**
- At startup the daemon runs `$SHELL -l -c 'exec workd internal-dump-env'` once
  and uses that environment (minus per-terminal variables like `TERM`, `PWD`,
  `SSH_TTY`, `TMUX`) for every launched process. This is what puts
  `~/.local/bin` (e.g. `codex`) on `PATH` even though the daemon itself was
  started by a non-interactive SSH command. Fallback: the daemon's own env.
  Interactive (`-i`) capture was rejected: it runs prompt frameworks
  (powerlevel10k/gitstatus) that print noise and misbehave without a TTY.
- Terminal sessions without a command run `$SHELL -l`; commands run as
  `/bin/sh -c '<command>'` (see D-011 for why not `$SHELL`).
- The environment is handed to the process through a `0600` file read and
  deleted by `workd internal-exec <file> -- <argv>`, which then `exec`s the
  command with exactly that environment. **Never on a command line**: the tmux
  server keeps the argv of the client that started it, and argv is visible to
  all users via `ps`. (Found in testing: API keys from the login env showed up
  in the tmux server's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.) Enforced by a test.
- Every process also gets `WORKD_WORKSPACE_ID/NAME`, `WORKD_SESSION_ID/NAME`,
  `WORKD_EXECUTION_ID`.

## D-007 — tmux backend details (2026-10-07)

- Private tmux server per host (`~/.workd/run/tmux.sock`, own generated
  config); the user's own tmux is never touched. Requires tmux ≥ 3.2.
- One tmux session per **execution**, named after the execution id. Restarting
  a session creates a new execution and a new tmux session (rule 7).
- tmux is made invisible: no status bar, no prefix key, `remain-on-exit on`
  (exit status and final output stay readable), `window-size latest`.
  tmux's own client notices (`[detached (from session exec_…)]`) are filtered
  out of attach output.
- Attach = the daemon runs `tmux attach` inside a PTY it owns and bridges it to
  the client; detach uses `tmux detach-client` so the user's terminal is
  restored. Detach key in `workctl` is `Ctrl-]`.
- Exits are observed by polling `list-panes` every 500 ms. The same code
  reconciles state at startup: alive → adopt, dead → record exit, missing →
  `lost`.
- **tmux quirks handled** (found in testing, tmux 3.4):
  - When a process exits right after starting while other tmux clients are
    connecting, tmux sometimes marks the pane dead but never reaps the process,
    so it never learns the exit status. We read the zombie's status from
    `/proc/<pid>/stat` (Linux), and otherwise wait up to 2 s for tmux before
    recording an unknown status.
  - Without a UTF-8 locale (typical for daemons started over plain SSH) tmux
    rewrites tabs in command output as `_`. All tmux commands run with `-u`, and
    `list-panes` output uses `|` separators.

**Revisit** polling if many hosts × sessions make it costly (tmux hooks →
`workd` notification).

## D-008 — Daemon lifecycle (2026-10-07)

- Single instance per `WORKD_HOME` via `flock` on `run/workd.lock`.
- `workd dial` auto-starts `workd serve` fully detached (`setsid`, stdio to
  `logs/workd.log`) so it outlives the SSH connection.
- `daemon.shutdown` (`workctl host shutdown`) stops the daemon but **not**
  managed processes; the next connection starts a fresh daemon, which
  reconciles. This is also the upgrade path: replace the binary, shut down.
- `WORKD_HOME` / `--home` relocate everything (used by tests and for running
  several daemons on one machine). Socket paths must stay under ~100 bytes.

## D-009 — Sessions and addressing (2026-10-07)

- Kinds: `terminal` (interactive; login shell or any command — e.g. `codex`),
  `service` (long-running, command required), `task` (runs to completion,
  command required), `agent` (a coding agent; see D-013).
- Session status derives from its current execution: `running`, `completed`
  (exit 0), `failed` (non-zero, or failed to start), `stopped`, `lost`.
- Workspace names are unique per host; ids (`ws_…`, `ses_…`, `exec_…`) are
  random and unique across hosts. The CLI addresses
  `[host:]workspace[/session]` and searches all hosts concurrently; the host
  prefix is only needed when a name exists on several hosts.
- Deleting a workspace stops its sessions and removes its directory only if it
  is the managed `~/.workd/workspaces/<id>` (rule: cleanup only touches managed
  resources).

## D-010 — Git: bare backing repository, one worktree per workspace (2026-10-07)

- First use of a repository on a host: `git clone --bare` into
  `~/.workd/repos/<repo-id>/base`, with `remote.origin.fetch` set so branches
  appear as `origin/*` (a bare clone doesn't do that by default). Bare because
  nobody should work in the backing checkout.
- `<repo-id>` = last path component + a stable hash of the normalized URL
  (`suger-api-1a2b3c4d`): readable, collision-free across orgs.
- Every Git workspace: `git fetch --prune`, then `git worktree add` at
  `~/.workd/workspaces/<id>/repo`.
  - `--branch B` that exists (locally or as `origin/B`) is checked out;
    otherwise a new branch is created — `B`, or `workd/<name-slug>` — from
    `--base` (default: origin's default branch, via `remote set-head --auto`).
- Fetch/worktree operations are serialized per repository.
- Credentials: whatever `git` on the host already uses; `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`
  so a missing credential fails instead of hanging. Error messages are
  scrubbed of `user:token@` in URLs.
- Deleting a workspace removes the worktree but **keeps the branch** (it may
  hold unpushed work) and never touches the backing repository. It refuses if
  the worktree has uncommitted changes unless forced (`--force`).
- Preparation (clone/fetch/worktree/environment) runs in the background: the
  workspace is `preparing` with a progress message, then `ready` (sessions
  start) or `failed` (sessions stay pending; `workctl ws prepare` retries). A
  daemon restart resumes interrupted preparation; deleting cancels it.

## D-011 — Environments: direnv, resolved explicitly (2026-10-07)

- A workspace whose root has an `.envrc` gets the **Direnv** environment:
  `direnv export json` (run in the root, with the login environment) is applied
  on top of the login environment, and every managed process in the workspace
  starts with the result. Verified with `use flake` on a real flake: the Nix
  dev shell's tools and `shellHook` exports reach sessions.
- `direnv allow` is run automatically **only** for worktrees Workd created from
  a repository the user asked for. An existing directory must already be
  allowed (otherwise the workspace fails with direnv's message).
- If the environment fails, the workspace fails and its sessions do not start
  (rather than running agents in the wrong environment).
- Resolved environments are kept in memory only (they can contain secrets) and
  re-resolved after a daemon restart.
- Commands (`service`/`task`/terminal with a command) run via `/bin/sh -c`, not
  the user's shell: a POSIX shell doesn't re-run the user's startup files,
  which could reorder `PATH` and undo the resolved environment. Interactive
  terminals still run `$SHELL -l` — the user's shell startup files apply there,
  as they would after `ssh`.

## D-012 — Existing-directory workspaces (2026-10-07)

Design §15 allowed V1 to skip them; they were cheap, so they exist:
`workctl new x --dir /path`. The directory is **attached, not managed**: never
created or deleted by Workd (rule §29).

## D-013 — Codex integration: launch with `--no-daemon`, observe the rollout transcript (2026-10-07)

*Open decision in design §35 (Codex state detection); current choice.*

Investigated for codex-cli 0.159.1: `notify` config (turn-complete only, and a
`-c` override replaces the user's own `notify`), a hooks system
(`SessionStart`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, … — per-launch hooks only run
with `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`), the experimental app-server protocol
(has exactly the states we want: `waitingOnApproval`, `waitingOnUserInput`),
and the rollout transcript.

**Decision.** Workd changes nothing about Codex's configuration and uses no
"dangerous" flags:

- Launch: `codex --no-daemon [prompt]`; restart: `codex --no-daemon resume
  <id>`. By default the Codex TUI attaches to a shared, self-updating
  background daemon (observed at a different version than the CLI), so the
  agent's work would live outside the process Workd manages; `--no-daemon`
  keeps execution/lost/restart semantics meaningful. Cost: those sessions
  don't appear in `codex agents` / remote control.
- The agent binary is the session's process (no shell in between).
- **Identity:** the rollout file `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`;
  its first record (`session_meta`) has the conversation id (stored as the
  session's opaque `provider_session_id`, used to resume) and cwd. Codex creates it lazily (after the first interaction), so it's
  discovered after launch: from the process's open files (Linux `/proc`), else
  by cwd + start time, skipping conversations bound to other sessions.
- **State** from transcript records: `task_started` → working;
  `task_complete` → waiting for input (with `last_agent_message`);
  `turn_aborted` → idle.
- **Heuristic (unverified against real approval prompts):** approval requests
  and questions aren't in the transcript. An agent that is mid-turn and whose
  terminal *and* transcript have been quiet for `WORKD_AGENT_QUIET_SECS`
  (default 8 s) is marked `blocked`. If the Codex spinner keeps animating
  during an approval prompt, this misses (never cries wolf during long model
  thinking). Likewise a freshly started agent that goes quiet becomes `idle`.

**Open for the user to decide:**
1. Use hooks via `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` for exact approval detection
   (`PermissionRequest`)? Precise, but bypasses Codex's hook trust checks for
   that process.
2. Calibrate the quiet heuristic with a few real Codex turns.
3. Codex asks "trust this folder?" for every new worktree path and stores the
   answer in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Workd could pre-trust its own worktrees
   with `-c projects."<root>".trust_level=…`, but trust level changes Codex's
   approval defaults, so that's left to the user.

Everything parses defensively: the rollout format belongs to a self-updating
binary. The message excerpt is stored in `state.json` only, never in
`events.jsonl`.

## D-014 — Attention: derived from transitions, one open item per session (2026-10-07)

- Raised by: agent finished a turn (`review`, with the message excerpt),
  agent quiet mid-turn (`approval`, heuristic), task succeeded (`completion`),
  task/service failed or a process disappeared (`failure`), a session failed to
  start or a workspace failed to prepare (`failure`). Leaving a shell or
  quitting an agent cleanly raises nothing.
- Resolved by: attaching to or typing into the session, restarting / stopping /
  deleting it, the agent starting to work again, a newer item for the same
  session, or `workctl ack`.
- Stored on the workspace (`state.json`); `AttentionCreated` /
  `AttentionResolved` events carry ids and kinds only.
- Each workspace derives one **activity** for the primary view:
  NEEDS YOU (question/approval/review) › FAILED › PREPARING › WORKING (an agent
  working, or a service/task running — not an idle shell) › COMPLETED › IDLE.
  `workctl ls` groups by it; `workctl ls --watch` redraws on every event.
- `workctl new` starts Codex + a shell by default (design §27); `--no-agent`,
  `--no-shell` opt out.

## D-015 — Hardening pass: agent provider boundary (2026-10-07)

Audit of the code against [`architecture-lessons.md`](architecture-lessons.md).
Most of it already held (Git optional, sessions ≠ processes, tmux behind the
backend, one daemon, SSH as transport, no local-filesystem assumptions in the
control plane). Changed only what leaked:

- **Observation moved behind the provider.** `AgentProvider` is now `id`,
  `detect`, `launch_argv`, `observe`. Generic reconciliation passes an
  `ObserveContext` (cwd, start time, pid, last terminal output, env) and applies
  the returned generic `Observation`; transcript discovery, reading and the
  quiet-turn heuristic (`WORKD_AGENT_QUIET_SECS`) now live in `agents/codex.rs`.
- **Provider data is opaque.** `AgentInfo.transcript` / `transcript_offset`
  became `provider_state` (JSON only the provider reads); `resume_id` became
  `provider_session_id` (older `state.json` still loads via an alias).
- **Hosts advertise agent providers.** `HostStatus.agents` lists each
  supported provider with availability, version and `can_resume`, from the
  provider registry, instead of `codex` sitting in the tool list.
- The default provider is one constant (`agents::DEFAULT_PROVIDER`).
- Docs: [`invariants.md`](invariants.md) (each invariant → where enforced and
  tested) and `AGENTS.md` as a router.

Deliberately not done (architecture-lessons §24): other providers, plugin
mechanisms, orchestration. Next: dogfooding.
